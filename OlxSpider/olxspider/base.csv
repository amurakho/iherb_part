For decades, Americans have been told to avoid table salt.  But when iodized table salt is reduced, people can unknowingly lower their  iodine intake to suboptimal levels. Analyses from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that urinary iodine levels have  plummeted since the 1970s.","https://s3.images-iherb.com/lex/lex17406/t/43.jpg,https://s3.images-iherb.com/lex/lex17406/t/44.jpg","Life Extension, Sea-Iodine, 1,000 mcg, 60 Vegetarian Capsules",LEX-17406
